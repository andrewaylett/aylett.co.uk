Every parent agrees that a good education is one of the most vital and
significant aspects of their child’s development and preparation for adulthood.
Some parents go to great lengths to access the right school: moving house to be
in the right catchment area or paying steep fees for their child to attend one
of the prestigious private schools. Why? Because there is an undisputed and
clear correlation between the education of a child and their later success as an
adult.

Where to educate? The stakes are high because the consequences are huge. Parents
must decide. Some parents try to avoid any risk by opting for the conventional
and safe option. But is it safe to put God in a box? Is it possible to put God
in a box and still regard Him as Almighty God? Although you might not think
about it in these terms, a child in a non-Christian school is taught that God,
if He is even acknowledged, belongs in a box, isolated and separate from life.

Ultimately every Christian parent provides a level of Christian Education for
his or her child in their daily worship and the example of the parent’s everyday
life. If you are a parent you will know how difficult this can be, particularly
to do so consistently. Children are very quick to notice inconsistency.

The mind of a child is like a sponge, absorbing information and learning easily.
But, particularly when they are young, children will accept information without
thinking about it critically. The ‘innocence’ of a child to accept at face value
what they are told is something that makes a child both charming and vulnerable.
“But my teacher said…” is a powerful and persuasive argument in the mind of a
child.

Everyone knows that a child’s security and stability would be compromised were
the parents to argue and undermine one another all the time.

Yet to some extent this is what happens when Christian parents send their
children to be educated in a non-Christian school. The school speaks in the
place of the parents. Yet, for Christian parents, the non-Christian school
immerses their child into a world-view that conflicts with and undermines the
parents' God-given responsibility to train their children.

Attending mainstream school, children from a Christian home become familiar and
comfortable with both environments, and develop an ability to move seamlessly
between the two: home life within a Christian context and outside the home in a
non-Christian context.

Yes, God is sovereign, and works graciously, and there are examples of young
adults who later repent and return to the Saviour. But there are many more
examples of young adults who continue regardless, and show no sign of returning.

Issues to do with authority, morality, relationships, and ethics all stem from
this, and the current deterioration of ‘Christian’ standards within
non-Christian schools is an inevitable consequence of a world-view that excludes
the living God. It is acknowledged that there is not a complete absence of
religious education in non-Christian schools. However where religion is taught
it is in isolation from other subjects – effectively religion is portrayed as a
consequence-free personal choice, and one that has no particular relevance upon
the everyday ‘real world’.

Although some element of traditional values may be found in different schools,
particularly where there is a good class teacher – ultimately secular humanism,
where God is either excluded or merely tolerated, governs the overall system
that actively denies the Lordship of Christ.

The intention of providing a full-time Christian Education is that it will
complement (not substitute) what the child learns at home and in Church. No
educational system can ultimately shelter a child from ‘the world’ but the
correct system can prepare the child to increasingly make a constructive
contribution. Christian Education is not about isolation; it is about the best
possible preparation for a child who must live in a complex and demanding world.

God instructs His people to teach their children diligently at all times
(Deuteronomy 6 particularly v7-9) at home… outside the home… in the evening… in
the morning. This does not mean that the parents must do all the teaching
directly, but it does mean that when they delegate, it must be to someone who
will instruct, nurture, and direct the child according to these same principles.

Many Christian parents are uncomfortable with the thought of full-time Christian
Education, in part because they know that if they allow themselves to become
convinced then they must either act or compromise. But failure to think through
the issues is also to compromise.

There is a cost. But there is also a cost to refusing full-time Christian
Education. The choice for parents is which cost are they willing to bear?

One option is to consider Mannafields Christian School, where with over 20 years
of experience, children are taught within a context that recognises the ultimate
authority of God’s Word. Mannafields acknowledges that control of the child’s
education is the responsibility of parents, and anticipates parental involvement
in all the different aspects of school life, while still providing a high
standard of teaching.

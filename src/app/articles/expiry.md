Articles on this website have an expiry date. It's something you'll see more
often in official archives, but I think it's a useful concept to apply more
generally.

The idea of an expiry isn't necessarily to say that the document is useless
after that date, nor that it will need to be changed. But that the author knows
that the world changes around old documents: it's important to be able to tell
if what you're looking at is considered "current" or if it's potentially
out-of-date: either describing technologies you wouldn't use any more, opinions
the author may have developed since, or generally a stale view of the world.

I'm expecting -- at least on this website -- that most of the articles will have
long expiry dates and won't need major revision when reviewed. Time will tell.
I'll revise this document if and when it's necessary

In a similar vein to [Simon Wilison's TIL](https://til.simonwillison.net/), I've
decided to start trying to note some [thoughts](/thoughts) in shorter and
less-well-formed form than my articles. They're also not attributed with the
same revision/revised/expires metadata that my articles have -- they have a date
attached, and that's it.

You may legitimately question whether "less well-formed" is even possible, but
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. They're hopefully not going to be exclusively drawn from comments I've made
on social media, but where they are, it's in the interests of pulling them out
of a random thread and into something under my control.

I'm toying with using LLMs to help me classify and add metadata to thoughts. So
if you think the titles are a bit pretentious, or the tags (when they appear) a
little OTT, blame my LLM editor. (Or actually, don't: I may have enlisted an LLM
to help generate content, but I'm still responsible for the content I publish)

In a similar vein to [Simon Wilison's TIL](https://til.simonwillison.net/), I've
decided to start trying to note some [thoughts](/thoughts) in shorter and
less-well-formed form than my articles. They're also not attributed with the
same revision/revised/expires metadata that my articles have -- they have a date
attached, and that's it.

You may legitimately question whether "less well-formed" is even possible, but
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. They're hopefully not going to be exclusively drawn from comments I've made
on social media, but where they are, it's in the interests of pulling them out
of a random thread and into something under my control.

I'm toying with using LLMs to help me classify and add metadata to thoughts. So
if you think the titles and descriptions are a bit pretentious, or the tags
(when they appear) a little OTT, blame my LLM editor. (Or actually, don't: I may
have enlisted an LLM to help generate content, but I'm still responsible for the
content I publish)

It’s been snowing, and as we were planning to see friends who live in the
country and Lidl have been selling snow chains for £20, I decided to buy some.
We used them this afternoon, and as it’s the first time I’ve used chains I
learned a few things which I thought I’d share.

I was very glad to have tried putting them on in the driveway before we left —
that gave me extra confidence and it really helped as I was under a bit more
pressure when actually fitting them for use. I only practised fitting one tyre,
that was enough.

My first lesson was that chains are only useful when you actually use them. Our
friends live at the top of a hill, and the road past their house, up that hill,
was the only non-gritted part of our drive. I looked at it, and thought I’d
probably make it up anyway. Of course, I didn’t — we stopped half-way, and a
tractor came the other way while I was trying to put the chains on (both
blocking the single-track road for the other). We reversed back down (with one
chain on) and parked at the bottom of the hill.

Later, as we really wanted to avoid having to walk back to the car with the
children in the dark, I went to put the other chain on so I could bring the car
up to the house. It was already quite dark by this point, and the second chain
was a little twisted. Lesson two: if your chain is at all tangled, untangle it
completely before putting it behind the wheel. I had to take it back out,
untangle it, and try again. The instructions said to lay it out on the road; I
can see why now. At this point, it’s worth mentioning lesson three: you may need
to kneel. I had waterproof trousers on already and they made it much easier to
decide to do that.

Both chains on, I could drive up the hill with no issues at all. Lesson four is
that snow chains actually work.

A concern of mine (which was what prompted me to try the hill without chains) is
that you’re not supposed to use chains directly on tarmac. There wasn’t much
ice, so I was worried I’d damage something. After we left, having come back down
the hill and on to the gritted road, I learned lesson five: it’s very obvious
when you hit tarmac with chains; you can really hear the noise they make. This
indicates that you don’t actually need much ice (or even slush) on the road to
be able to use chains, if it’s a consistent covering.

The last lesson is that removal is, if anything, even easier than putting them
on. Unclipping the chains was easy and this time I providentially had my wheels
the right way up first time, so I could undo the clasp at the back of the wheel.
I then ran the car down the road a few metres and went back to pick the chains
up. I suspect that getting the wheels the right way up is the key to easy
removal.

I’m glad to have got the chains, and I’m much more confident about using them
now. I doubt they’ll be a regular sight on my tyres, but for the last icy bits
of journeys, or if our estate gets frozen up again as it was a couple of years
ago, they’ll be very useful.

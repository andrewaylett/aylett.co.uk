I want to try to write a little bit about giving and taking offense.
I'm not sure some people realize that what you do or don't take offense at can reveal an awful lot about what you do or don't care about.
Or indeed who you do or don't care about.

This is in no small part triggered by some of the furore around git repositories.
Back in the day, a reasonably young, eastern European developer decided that the right thing to do was to call the primary branch of a git repository "master".

Now, especially around black lives matter, what we call things and especially when they are words that have charged undertones from history, has become somewhat important.

It's not necessarily a question of whether things are literally right or wrong.
For instance, I wouldn't tend to use the word "niggardly" in general conversation.
Because the only people who use the word niggardly are using it in the hope that someone will say "you can't say that", so that they can point out that actually the etymology is completely different and that they are allowed to say it after all.

It's only spoken in order to cause offense.
So that you can then complain that that offense was unjustified.

But with the word "master", the important thing is not so much whether or not it's right or wrong, but how much do you care about the other people.
Those who think that it would be better to have it, or better to not have it.
And most specifically, how much you care about the people who would prefer that maybe you use a different word after all.

It's not a big change to make.
It's not going to cure all the world's ills or make life particularly better for anyone.
Apart from that it shows that you care.
And: do you care more about the people who would prefer you not to use the word, "master" in this case, than you do about the tiny amount of inconvenience that it's going to cause you.

Pre-pandemic we’d often have a meeting which was essentially a presentation, and
the “post-meeting meeting” at the coffee machine afterwards would actually cause
more forward progress than the meeting. This wasn’t particularly helpful for
anyone WFH or in a different office.

I’ve been trying to consciously shift things so the presentation is a document
and the _actual meeting_ happens in the actual meeting. This goes very nicely
with \[a colleague's] hint about pre-reads.

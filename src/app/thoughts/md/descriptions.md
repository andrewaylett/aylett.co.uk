I've decided to start generating site metadata using GPT. The specific endpoint
and prompt I'm using is visible in the site source, and the output is committed
to the repository rather than being dynamically generated.

This means that while the titles and especially the descriptions can be a bit
pretentious, they're still my responsibility. They're subject to review and
further editing as part of my publishing process.

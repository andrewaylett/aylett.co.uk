Per the subhead, this is not (really) a privacy policy.
This site doesn't have a cookie banner, because it doesn't set any cookies.
We don't have a log retention policy because I don't have any logs to retain.

My goal with this site, as it is with any professional work I do, is to avoid having to ask for any consent under the GDPR.
The easiest way to achieve that is to not process any personal data; if I have to process personal data I'm going to try to keep it within the bounds of lawful bases that aren't consent.
Obviously if that happens I'll be adding details as required.

The site is hosted by [Vercel](/_logs), and they see all the requests made.
Additionally, I use [plausible.io](https://plausible.io/aylett.co.uk) to collect events.
Neither provider collects personal data for visitors to the site.

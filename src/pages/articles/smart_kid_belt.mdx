- A child restraint that's just a strap to hold the shoulder belt down.
- Does actually have a type approval: `E20 44R-04 4013`, linked from their website: https://smartkidbelt.com/img/cms/smart-kid-belt-swiadectwo-homologacji-ece.pdf
- Harmonised by [[UNECE]].
- The Russians -- in WP.29 session 181 -- are unconvinced:

        - "cannot be consideredas a child restraint system"
        - "The mentioned certificate had been cancelled"
            - [[GRSP]] session 66 report: https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/doc/2019/wp29grsp/ECE-TRANS-WP.29-GRSP-66e.pdf
            - 27.The   expert   from   EC   introduced   ECE/TRANS/WP.29/GRSP/2019/28 aimed   atclarifyingthe types of belt-guides and sitting devices that would not be allowed by means of anexplanationin the scope of the UN Regulation.The expert from Poland argued that the proposal from EC was restrictive and requested a facts-based discussion on this proposal or a simplerejectionin full. He introduced a presentation GRSP-66-19,showing that oneof the devicesin ECE/TRANS/WP.29/GRSP/2019/28was fully compliant with UN Regulation No. 44and safercomparedto other type approvedCRS. The expert from Spain introduced GRSP-66-30which providedcounter  evidence that  belt-guide devices would  not  comply  to  a number of relevant requirements of UN Regulation No. 44. The expert from Japan introduced a presentation(GRSP-66-38)showing the sled test conducted on Q dummiesto check safety-belt  penetration according  to  UN  Regulation  No  129  requirements.  He  concluded  that the abdominal pressure on the belt-guide device was found to be rather high compared to CRS type approvalaccording to UN Regulation No. 129, but that it satisfied the requirements of the UNRegulation.
            - 28.Finally, the majority of GRSP experts, with the exception of the expert from Poland, adopted ECE/TRANS/WP.29/GRSP/2019/28, not amended. The secretariat was requested to submit the proposalas part of (see para. 26)Supplement 18 to the 04 series of amendments to UN Regulation No. 44, for consideration and vote at the June 2020sessions of WP.29 and AC.1.
- The Dutch -- in the Working Party on Passive Safety ([[GRSP]]) also unconvinced, entering documents into the 67th session:

    - While the Poles say it's OK:

        - 30.The expert from Poland requested deferral of discussion on the belt-guide, that was type approved by the authority of her country, to the December 2020 session of GRSP due to the research test results on the belt-guide, which had not yet been made available by the expert of EC. The experts from the Netherlands and ANEC/CI argued that discussion  was needed on this subject since they considered this type of CRS as dangerous. The expert from the Netherlands introduced GRSP-67-05 explaining that the belt-guide was not in the scope of the UN Regulation and could not be type approved; as such, the type approval should be withdrawn.  "Finally,  with reference to  the  procedure  of  the  1958  Agreement,  Revision  3,Articles 4.2., 10.4 and Schedule 6 (paragraphs 2 and 3), he stated that through GRSP-67-05 he sought support from other contracting parties and cooperation from the expert of Poland to avoid starting the arbitration process – according to Schedule 6 of the 1958 Agreement." The expert from ANEC/CI, introduced GRSP-67-10 and GRSP-67-36 showing the high risk of abdominal injuries in both cases due to severe submarining. In anticipation of the above-mentioned test results, the expert from Poland introduced GRSP-67-32, showing some resultsof tests demonstrating the performance of this belt-guide type under laboratory conditions. She also clarified that the belt-guide was type approved according to Supplement 10 to the 04 series of amendments. However, she added that according to some stakeholder opinions,this  belt-guide  type  should had  been  tested  according  to  Supplement  11,  thus  making  the  device subject to different criteria. However, she stated that in her opinion there was a clear legal basis which demonstrated that the type approval granted under Supplement 10 was the correct one. The expert of the Netherlands responded by stating that, apart from the fact that this  device  does  not  comply  with  several  requirements  of  UN  Regulation  No.  44,  a  supplement  only  clarifies  existing  requirements  or  test  procedures  and  does  not  introduce new requirements. Even when Supplement 10 was in force, it was evident that a belt guide could not be approved as a child restraint.31.The  expert  from  EC  recalled  to  GRSP,  that  the  group  had agreed to his  former proposal (ECE/TRANS/WP.29/GRSP/2019/28) to amend the scope of UN Regulation No 44 (Child Restraint  Systems)  with  clarification  that a  belt-guide  cannot  be  approved  under  Regulation     44     without     being     part     of     a     child     restraint     system     (see ECE/TRANS/WP.29/GRSP/66, paragraphs 27 and 28). However, he explained that EC had reconsidered the document submission to WP.29, since the interpretation that a “guide strap”and  similar  devices  cannot  be  separately  approved  as  a  child  restraint  system,  had  alreadybeen endorsed  by  WP.29  at  its  March  2012  session  (see  ECE/TRANS/WP.29/30.The expert from Poland requested deferral of discussion on the belt-guide, that was type approved by the authority of her country, to the December 2020 session of GRSP due to the research test results on the belt-guide, which had not yet been made available by the expert of EC.

            - Finally,  with reference to  the  procedure  of  the  1958  Agreement,  Revision  3,Articles 4.2., 10.4 and Schedule 6 (paragraphs 2 and 3), he stated that through GRSP-67-05 he sought support from other contracting parties and cooperation from the expert of Poland to avoid starting the arbitration process – according to Schedule 6 of the 1958 Agreement.
        - 31.The  expert  from  EC  recalled  to  GRSP,  that  the  group  had agreed to his  former proposal (ECE/TRANS/WP.29/GRSP/2019/28) to amend the scope of UN Regulation No 44 (Child Restraint  Systems)  with  clarification  that a  belt-guide  cannot  be  approved  under  Regulation     44     without     being     part     of     a     child     restraint     system     (see ECE/TRANS/WP.29/GRSP/66, paragraphs 27 and 28). However, he explained that EC had reconsidered the document submission to WP.29, since the interpretation that a “guide strap”and  similar  devices  cannot  be  separately  approved  as  a  child  restraint  system,  had  alreadybeen endorsed  by  WP.29  at  its  March  2012  session  (see  ECE/TRANS/WP.29/1095, paragraph 35). Therefore, he introduced GRSP-67-31, that was only on the phase out of UNRegulation No. 44.
        - 32.The Chair of GRSP referred to Schedule 6 of the 1958 Agreement, and stressed full consideration of  the different opinions of  the  Type  Approval  Authorities  of  the  concerned contracting parties, and of contracting parties applying UN Regulation No. 44. "Therefore, the experts  from  France,  Germany,  Italy,  Russian  Federation,  Spain,  Switzerland  and United Kingdom explicitly endorsed the request of the expert from the Netherlands to withdraw the type approval granted by Poland on the belt-guide, while none of the other present delegates indicated abstention or disagreement." The experts also noted that the Chair encouraged the expert  of  the  Netherlands  to  continue  discussions  with the Type  Approval  Authority  of Poland to seek cooperation with Poland in the aim to avoid the arbitration process according to Schedule 6 of the 1958 Agreement, which would start in the November 2020 session of WP.29.
            - Therefore, the experts  from  France,  Germany,  Italy,  Russian  Federation,  Spain,  Switzerland  and United Kingdom explicitly endorsed the request of the expert from the Netherlands to withdraw the type approval granted by Poland on the belt-guide, while none of the other present delegates indicated abstention or disagreement.
- I'm pretty sure the important paragraph is this one:
    - "Finally,  with reference to  the  procedure  of  the  1958  Agreement,  Revision  3,Articles 4.2., 10.4 and Schedule 6 (paragraphs 2 and 3), he stated that through GRSP-67-05 he sought support from other contracting parties and cooperation from the expert of Poland to avoid starting the arbitration process – according to Schedule 6 of the 1958 Agreement."
    - So the type certification remains while the Poles object, until and unless arbitration concludes.  But:
        - "Therefore, the experts  from  France,  Germany,  Italy,  Russian  Federation,  Spain,  Switzerland  and United Kingdom explicitly endorsed the request of the expert from the Netherlands to withdraw the type approval granted by Poland on the belt-guide, while none of the other present delegates indicated abstention or disagreement."
    - I am, therefore, not minded to use the device.
